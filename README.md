elm-hull
========

Web app to compute the convex hulls of drawn polygons.
[Demo here] (http://notnew.github.io/elm-hull/).

This is an elm program, a functional programming language that compiles to javascript, html and css. 
Instructions for installing elm can be found [here] 
(https://github.com/evancz/Elm/blob/master/README.md).

The hull is computed using [Andrew's monotone chain algorithm] 
(https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Algorithm_Implementation/Geometry/Convex_hull/Monotone_chain).
