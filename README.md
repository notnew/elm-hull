========

Program to compute the convex hulls of drawn polygons.

This is an elm program, instructions for installing elm can be found [here] (https://github.com/evancz/Elm/blob/master/README.md)

The hull is computed using [Andrew's monotone chain algorithm] (https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Algorithm_Implementation/Geometry/Convex_hull/Monotone_chain)
